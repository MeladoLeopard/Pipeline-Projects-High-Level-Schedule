# Pipeline-Projects-High-Level-Schedule
High Level Schedule 

The Problem:

In projects construction we need to always provide a schedule for the project's timeline. 
As it is hard and time consuming to develop a definitive schedule, where currently there is high dependency on contractors planners hence this code should assist in the high level schedule.

Project Definition:

This project/code aims to develop a high level schedule for pipeline projects.
It can be achieived by asking the user to provide certain inputs, which will be processed by the code and calculate an approximate schedule.
The data sources are predefined productivity and user inputs of project parameters
Required algorithm can be explained as: 1) Taking inputs from the user 2)Transforming the data by code process 3) Predicting an approximate schedule 

Deliverables:

The written code gives an approximate high level schedule for pipeline projects.
The results are straightforward calculations and will need to be assessed in real time projects.
Currently few parameters are considered, where more precise inputs can be taken to develop a definite and more accurate schedule.
The productivity rates are stated based on previous contractors performance, where these rates need to be verified perhaps against upcoming projects or contractor feedback.

Conclusion and Way Forward:

This code delivers a basic high level schedule for pipeline projects where it can save time and give insight to project engineers about the project duration.
However, there are areas of improvement that can be suggested once the code gets utilised.
For instance, the schedule can be printed out in Gantt Chart format.
Project breakdown activities can be studied to start in parallel.
The schedule can be exported into excel or pdf format.
Also the code can be altered to have embedded inputs rather than from user
